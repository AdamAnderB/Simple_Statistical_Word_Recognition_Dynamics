# Simple Statistical Word Recognition Dynamics (SWORD)

This repository contains code and materials for **Simple Statistical Word Recognition Dynamics (SWORD)**, a lightweight framework for modeling how listeners recognize words using statistical and prosodic cues. The project explores incremental word activation, cue integration, and how native vs. non-native listeners use different information during recognition.

## Project Overview

SWORD is designed to:
- Provide a simple, transparent model of word recognition dynamics  
- Explore how statistical and prosodic cues contribute to activation  
- Compare native (L1) and second language (L2) cue integration  
- Serve as a foundation for experimental extensions and future modeling work  

The goal is to offer a minimal but flexible modeling tool for investigating how listeners use cues in real time during word recognition.
