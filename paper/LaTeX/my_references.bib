               standard deviations remains a common practice. However, since
               both the mean and the standard deviation are particularly
               sensitive to outliers, this method is problematic. We highlight
               the disadvantages of this method and present the median absolute
               deviation, an alternative and more robust measure of dispersion
               that is easy to implement. We also explain the procedures for
