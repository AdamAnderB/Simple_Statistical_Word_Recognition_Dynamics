\section{Conclusions}

Our findings indicate that the relationship between music skills, cognitive abilities, and language skills is complex and demands continued investigations. We found that cognitive abilities, perceptual abilities, and productive abilities are variable in predictive power across languages. We also observed unexpected findings in which higher self-rated music abilities predicted weaker sensitivity to non-native speech. Taken together, we call for more nuanced approaches to measuring and assessing music abilities in more varied populations of language users and musicians across different linguistic and musical stimuli.
